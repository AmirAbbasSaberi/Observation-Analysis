## P001: Analysis of rigid body motions
One of the main tasks of surveyors is to measure geometrical changes due to the action of
forces affecting the object. In general, geometric changes are divided into two categories. The
first category is rigid body movement, in which the components of rotation and transfer
are examined, it is practically an isometric transformation. The second category is called
distortion, which can be said to include twisting, bending and strain, in other words, it
causes deformation in the body.
In this project, our focus is on investigating a geodetic network that has been established.
The network includes points 904 to 911 and 9400 to 9402, along with points 101 to 104.
The primary objective is to ensure the stability and functional reliability of a structure. To
achieve this, points 904 to 911 and 9400 to 9402 have been marked with deeply founded pil-
lars, indicating their stability for the specific task at hand. The structure itself is represented
by points 101 to 104 and is comprised of a monolithic block.

## P002: Aperiodic deformation of structures
This exercise focuses on the non-periodic deformation of structures such as dams or barrages
using the congruence model. The analysis is performed using two methods: pointwise analysis
and global analysis. These structures are subject to geodetic monitoring at regular intervals
due to their significant potential for hazard. This monitoring aims to detect any structural
failures that may occur.

## P003: Strain Analysis
It is necessary to perform a strain analysis in order to identify alterations in the internal
shape of the structure. The anticipated deformations are relatively minor compared to the
size of the object, allowing us to assume infinitesimal strain. This assumption holds true for
deformations occurring in the vicinity of differential points. As a result, the deformations
can be broadly described using the linear relationship X = Fx + t.

## P004: Kinematic Kalman Filter
The motion of the point is explained within the framework of a descriptive kinematic model
using recursive filtering. Typically, the kinematic Kalman filter is employed to depict the
typical trajectory of the pointâ€™s spatial and temporal displacement.
